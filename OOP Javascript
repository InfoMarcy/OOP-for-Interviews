1. Object Oriented Programming is a programing paradigm or style of programming that is centered around objects rahter 
than functions.

2. Languages that support object oriented programming: Java, Javascript, C#, Python, Ruby, Angular

3. Object is a group o related variables and functions combines into a unit. 
We refer to this variables as properties and the functions as methods

#4 PILLARS OF OBJECT ORIENTE PROGRAMING
1. ENCAPSULATION: is a group of related variables, and functions that operates on them into objects.

let employee = {
baseSalary: 30000,
overtime: 10,
rate:20,
    getWage: function (){
          return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate)
    };

};

employee.getWage();

2. ABSTRACTION:  Hide some of the properties and methods from the outside which gives us a couple of benefits.
    1. we'll make the interface of those objects simpler, using and understanding objects with a few properties and methods 
    is easier than objects with several properties and methods.
    2. Hepls us reduce the impact of change


3. INHERITANCE:  is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code.
4. POLYMORPHISM: poly means many and and morph means forms. so polymorphism means many forms.
In object oriented programming polymorphism is a tecnique that allows you to get rid of long if and else statements, or switch
and case statements.

#BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
1.Using encapsulation, we group related variables and functions together, and in this way we can reduce complexity.
Now we can re-use this object in different parrts of the program, or in different programs.

2. With Abstraccion, we hide the details and the complexity and show only the essentials. This tecnique reduces complexity,
and also isolates  the impact of changes in the code.

3. With Inheritance we can eliminate redundant code,

4. With POlymorpfhism we can refactor ugly switch case statements
